        <center><h2>A Little About Us! <br> <img src="images/Gig Harbor Boats.jpg" height="395" width="512" alt="Gig Harbor Boats with Mt Rainier in Background" </h2></center>
        <p>We all started out as avid book lovers, but it was hard to share our
            love for books because we were each from different time zones. Eleanor
            is from PST, Megan from MST, Bri from CST, and Sienna from EST. We wanted
            to create a space where book lovers from coast to coast
            could gather and enjoy company and good books. That's how Coast to Coast
            came to be! We settled in Gig Harbor, WA because we loved that it was right
            near the coast and the town provided a great welcoming atmosphere for people
            from all over. Often referred to as the “Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula,” 
            Gig Harbor is a popular destination for those that love boating, hiking,
            fishing and shopping along the waterfront. So when you get done with all
            your outdoorsy adventures, stop on in for a good book and a hot drink!
